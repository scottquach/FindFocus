### Installing

To get the project running locally run the following commands.

```
npm ci
npm run start
```

This will spin up the project on `http://localhost:3000/`

### Creating widgets

#### Registering

First register your widget with a WidgetType id contained within the widget-types.enum.ts file.
The object will look similar to what's below.

```
export enum WidgetType {
	Spotify = 'spotify',
	SoundCloud = 'soundcloud',
	StickyNote = 'stickynote',
	YouTube = 'youtube',
	Weather = 'weather',
	Ambient = 'ambient',
	Quote = 'quote',
	Clock = 'clock',
	Timer = 'timer',
	TodosList = 'todoslist',
}
```

#### Creating widget component

Widget components can be created under the components/Widgets folder. A `<WidgetFrame></WidgetFrame>` host component serves as a foundation to maintain consistency across all created components.

View `components/Widgets/StickyNoteWidget` as a decent simple example.

#### Connecting your widget to the platform

1. You can define default widget attributes such as a friendly title, initial data configs, and min size within the `widget.model.ts` file. This tells the platform how to create and your widget.
2. Within `Grid.tsx` add your custom widget to the switch statement starting on line 81. This tells the grid what component to display based on a WidgetType
3. Add your widget to the widget picker menu in `components/WidgetPicker`. Simply follow the given format to add your custom button, name, and onClick handler. This will add the ability for the end user to add the widget to the grid via the widget picker menu.
